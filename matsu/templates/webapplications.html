				<p>The Namibia Flood Dashboard is a NASA SensorWeb enabled tool developed for flood and waterborne disease risk management in Namibia
                          	and the surrounding Southern Africa region. The dashboard provides daily water level information from space-based and ground sensor data, useful
                          	for local decision makers and disaster relief management.
                       		</p>
				<p>The Namibia Flood-Disease Early Warning Project is a collaborative effort of the Open Cloud Consortium and the Open Science Data Cloud, 
                          	the Namibia Ministry of Agriculture Water and Forestry (MAWF) Department of Water Affairs, NASA and the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS) 
                          	Working Group on Information Systems and Services (WGISS), and the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management 
                          	and Emergency Response (UN-SPIDER).

				<p>The Science Algorithm Server is a showcase of the possibilities of an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Compliant RESTful Secure Web Coverage 
                                  Processing Service (WCPS) for EO-1 ALI and Hyperion (mainly but not limited to) imagery.  
                                  The Server allows users to generate, run, and share algorithms for processing satellite data.
