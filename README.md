=====

Project Matsu is a collaboration between NASA and the Open Cloud Consortium to develop open source technology for cloud-based processing of satellite imagery to support the earth sciences. 

This repo serves as the master version of the new matsu.opensciencedatacloud.org, which will bring the three Matsu websites (informational, analytics and web-applications) under one domain.
