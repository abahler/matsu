Project Matsu is a collaboration between NASA and the Open Cloud Consortium to develop open source technology for cloud-based processing of satellite imagery to support the earth sciences. 

This repo serves as the master version of the new matsu.opensciencedatacloud.org, which will bring the three Matsu websites under one domain.

The three websites are currently as follows:
  matsu.opensciencedatacloud.org: informational
  matsu-analytics.opensciencedatacloud.org: analytics
  matsu.opencloudconsortium.org: web applications
